                    <h4>Ingredients</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li>1/4th cup gram flour (besan)</li>
                        <li>Turmeric as required</li>
                        <li>3 tsp, grated paneer</li>
                        <li>Oil as required</li>
                        <li>2 tsp, whole wheat flour</li>
                        <li>A pinch, Ajwain</li>
                        <li>Salt to taste</li>
                        <li>2 tsp, finely chopped green capsicum</li>
                        <li>2 tsp, grated carrot</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h4>Cooking Instructions</h4>
                    <p>Heat a sauté pan and add little oil to it.
                        Add chopped vegetable and sauté for some time.
                        Now add salt to taste and mix well. Remove the pan from the flame and let the vegetables cool.
                        Once at room temperature, add grated paneer to the mixture and mix well.
                        Mix wheat flour, gram flour and oats flour in a bowl. Add turmeric powder, Ajwain and salt in the bowl and mix well. Keep adding water to form a thick batter-like consistency.
                        Mix all the ingredients well to prepare a batter. There should not be lumps in the batter.
                        Make sure the consistency of the batter is thick. Once the batter is formed, cover with a lid and keep it aside for about 10-15 minutes.
                        Heat a pan on medium flame, smear 1 teaspoon oil and pour 2 tablespoon of the batter. Spread the batter in a circular motion till a thin layer is formed.
                        Now pour some oil on this pancake and turn it to other side. Cook the cheela from both the sides, ensuring that it doesn't burn.
                        Once cooked, put a spoonful of filling on it and flip the one side onto the other to close it.
                        Remove it from pan once it is crispy and appears brown in colour. Follow this method for making more cheelas.
                        Serve cheela hot with mint-coriander chutney or tomato chutney.</p>
